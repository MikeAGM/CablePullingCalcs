# CablePullingCalcs
This is a beta version of a cable pulling calculation tool. The goal is to create an accurate and user-friendly app for engineers. More testing is needed to ensure reliability before adding a full user interface. Contributions and feedback are welcome to improve the tool for real-world applications.


CablePullV3_1 Notebook
This Google Colab notebook is designed for simulating and analyzing cable pulling forces and scenarios. It allows users to input parameters related to cable pulling and perform calculations to ensure efficient cable installation and maintenance. Below is a guide on how to set up, run, and use this notebook.

Requirements
This notebook requires no installation as it is designed to run in Google Colab. The only prerequisites are:

A Google account to run the notebook in Google Colab.
Basic understanding of Python and cable-pulling engineering principles.
How to Use the Notebook
1. Open in Google Colab
You can open this notebook in Google Colab directly using the following steps:

Go to Google Colab.
Upload the notebook file (CablePullV3_1_pynb.ipynb).
2. Set Up
Once the notebook is open:

Ensure that the necessary libraries are installed by running the first code block (dependencies installation). All the required Python packages should automatically be installed.
3. Define Input Parameters
The notebook allows users to define various input parameters for the cable pulling scenario, such as:

Cable length
Conduit dimensions
Cable tension values
Pulling angles
Modify the parameter values in the input section according to your project specifications.

4. Run Calculations
Run the notebook cell by cell using the “Run” button next to each cell or use "Runtime > Run All" from the menu to execute the entire notebook. This will perform calculations based on the input parameters, providing results such as:

Maximum pulling tension
Cable stress levels
Recommended installation techniques
5. Review Outputs
The notebook generates a variety of outputs, including:

Graphs and charts for tension profiles.
Tables showing calculated values for stress, tension, and cable specifications.
Log messages indicating the status of the calculations.
Input Parameters
To customize the simulation for your specific case, edit the following input fields:

Cable Length: The total length of the cable to be pulled.
Cable Diameter: The thickness of the cable, which impacts the tension required.
Conduit Material: The type of material for the conduit through which the cable will pass.
Bend Angles: Define any angles the cable needs to pass through during pulling.
These input parameters can be changed in the corresponding cells at the top of the notebook.

Outputs
The following outputs are generated by the notebook:

Tension Profiles: A graphical representation of the tension distribution along the cable path.
Stress Calculations: Detailed tables showing the stress on the cable at different points.
Cable Installation Feasibility: Recommendations based on the calculated values, ensuring cable installation is within safe limits.
Customization
This notebook is fully customizable. Users with Python experience can modify the calculation methods or add additional input/output fields to suit specific project needs.
