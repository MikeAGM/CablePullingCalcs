# CablePullingCalcs
This is a beta version of a cable pulling calculation tool. The goal is to create an accurate and user-friendly app for engineers. More testing is needed to ensure reliability before adding a full user interface. Contributions and feedback are welcome to improve the tool for real-world applications.


CablePullV3_1 Notebook
This Google Colab notebook is designed for simulating and analyzing cable pulling forces and scenarios. It allows users to input parameters related to cable pulling and perform calculations to ensure efficient cable installation and maintenance. Below is a guide on how to set up, run, and use this notebook.

What can it do?

Calculate Maximun allowble tension foward direction and reversed as well as lubircant needed, sugessted back tension and the ability to load a COF data base. 

You can open this notebook in Google Colab directly.

Set Up:

Once the notebook is open:
Ensure that the necessary libraries are installed by running the first code block (dependencies installation). All the required Python packages should automatically be installed.

Define Input Parameters
The notebook allows users to define various input parameters for the cable pulling scenario, such as:

Run Calculations
Run the notebook cell by cell using the “Run” button next to each cell or use "Runtime > Run All" from the menu to execute the entire notebook. This will perform calculations based on the input parameters, providing results such as:

Review Outputs
The notebook generates a variety of outputs and added notes if required.
